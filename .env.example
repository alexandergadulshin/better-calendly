# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Database (Local development only - Vercel Postgres will be used in production)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/better-calendly"

# Note: Production environment variables will be automatically configured
# through Vercel integrations:
# - Vercel Postgres integration will add POSTGRES_* variables
# - Clerk integration will add CLERK_* variables
# - Additional services can be added as needed
